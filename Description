For Bone Detection System, We had to detect bone fracture into Major, Minor Fracture, Dislocation or Not Fracture from the Xray images.

Dataset was collected using Google search engine for Major, Minor or Dislocation Xray images and from Kaggle Not Fracture images were collected.

Tensorflow module Keras for neural network was used.
Using ImageDataGenerator, we generated train and validation batches.
We used Functional Api provided by Keras for developing 7 layers.
We acheived 75% accuracy from model predictions.

We used opencv modules findcontours and drawcontours for the bounding box, no. of cracks, dislocation measurement and obtaining the bone width and height.

Using the opencv blur function, we remove noise from any specified image and converted to a clearer image for detection.
The image is also being saved by diagnosis result.
